# Getting started

Load the library.
This is available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CorporaCoCo) and the latest development versions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mahlberg-lab/CorporaCoCo).
```{r}
library(CorporaCoCo)
```

## corp\_text

A passage from *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*:
```{r}
a <- "`But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it."
```
Create a `corp_text` object:
```{r}
a_text <- corp_text(a)
```
We used the default tokenization, so let's look at the type mappings:
```{r}
corp_type_lookup(a_text)
```
You can combine `corp_text` objects:
```{r}
aa <- "The cat sat on the mat."
bb <- "This dog ate this cat."
aaa <- corp_text(aa)
bbb <- corp_text(bb)
ccc <- list(aaa, bbb)
corp_text_rbindlist(ccc)
```

## corp\_concordance
You can look at concordance lines using `corp_text` objects:
```{r}
corp_concordance(a_text, span = "4LR", nodes = c("eat"))
```
If you supply one or more `collocates`, they will be highlighted and act as a filter:
```{r}
# filtering for one collocate
y <- corp_concordance(a_text, span = "4LR", nodes = c("eat"), collocates = c("but"))
y

# filtering for two collocates
y <- corp_concordance(a_text, span = "4LR", nodes = c("eat"), collocates = c("but", "and"))
y
```
If you do not want the collocates to act as a filter, but you just want to highlight them in the full concordance, you can add `collocates` to the `print` function:
```{r}
# rerunning the original concordance without a collocate filter
o <- corp_concordance(a_text, span = "4LR", nodes = c("eat"))

# printing the concordance and adding collocate highlighting
print(o, collocates = c("but"))
```

Because a `corp_concordance` object is just a `data.table` you can sort it, filter it. So in the following example of a slightly longer concordance, we can demonstrate the sorting by 1. the node and 2. the first type to the right of the node ("R1_type" position):

```{r}
s <- corp_concordance(a_text, span = "4LR", nodes = c("cats", "bats"))
s[order(N, R1_type)]
```

As with another `data.table`, you can also save the output to a csv file using `write.csv`, e.g. `write.csv(s, "concordance.csv")`.

You can sort the concordance using the *types* or the *tokens*:
```{r}
names(y)
```
and if you want to see the raw `data.table`:
```{r}
print(y, as_data_table = TRUE)
```

## corp\_surface
This works just like the old `surface` function but now you must pass it `corp_text` objects:
```{r}
a_cooccurs <- corp_surface(a_text, span = '1L1R', nodes = c("alice", "bats", "cats"))
```
By the way, if you do `corp_concordance` on a `corp_surface` object it will use the `span`, `nodes` and `collocates` values used to create the `corp_surface` object as the default values for `corp_concordance`:
```{r}
corp_concordance(a_cooccurs)
```

## corp\_coco
The same passage after it has been translated into Finnish and back to English using Google translate:
```{r}
b <- "`But cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here, Alice began to get pretty sleepy and went on to say to herself, in a dreamlike way: `Are cats eating bats? Are cats eating bats?' And sometimes, `Do cats have to eat cats?' since you see because he could not answer the questions, he did not really matter how he put it."
b_text <- corp_text(b)

b_cooccurs <- corp_surface(b_text, span = '1L1R', nodes = c("alice", "bats", "cats"))
b_cooccurs
```

```{r}
cats_and_bats <- corp_coco(a_cooccurs, b_cooccurs, nodes = c("alice", "bats", "cats"), fdr = 1.0)
```

```{r, fig.dim = c(7, 5)}
plot(cats_and_bats)
```

## Complex types

Looks like their is a difference for *cats* and *bats* but the text is small so we have no power.
Let's have a look at the tokenization:

```{r}
corp_type_lookup(a_text)
```

Since *cats* and *bats* are both types of mammals maybe we can look at the co-occurences with *mammals*:
```{r}
a_tokens <- corp_get_tokens(a_text)
b_tokens <- corp_get_tokens(b_text)

a_tokens$type <- sub("^(cats|bats)$", "MAMMALS", a_tokens$type)
b_tokens$type <- sub("^(cats|bats)$", "MAMMALS", b_tokens$type)

a_text_mammals <- corp_text(a, tokens = a_tokens)
b_text_mammals <- corp_text(b, tokens = b_tokens)
```
So now we have a new type to token mapping:
```{r}
corp_type_lookup(a_text_mammals)
```
and so:
```{r}
a_cooccurs_mammals <- corp_surface(a_text_mammals, span = '1L1R', nodes = c("alice", "MAMMALS"))
b_cooccurs_mammals <- corp_surface(b_text_mammals, span = '1L1R', nodes = c("alice", "MAMMALS"))

mammals <- corp_coco(a_cooccurs_mammals, b_cooccurs_mammals, nodes = c("alice", "MAMMALS"), fdr = 1.0)
```

```{r, fig.dim = c(7, 5)}
plot(mammals)
```
